# Mastercard Security Analyst Virtual Experience

Welcome to my Mastercard Security Analyst Virtual Experience repository! Here, I document my journey through the simulation, where I navigated the role of a Security Analyst and delved into designing a phishing email simulation for the Security Awareness team. Throughout this repository, I share valuable insights into various forms of cyber threats and the essential role individuals play in safeguarding companies and their employees, irrespective of technical background.

## Task 1: Design a phishing email simulation

#### What you'll learn

- What threat phishing presents to an organization 
- What different types of phishing emails look like
- How Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threats

#### What you'll do

- Examine an obvious fake email and make it more believable
  
### Let's give you some context

You are an analyst in our **Security Awareness Team.**

Our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on our team to help our staff learn how to identify and report security threats to Mastercard.

One of the most common threats organizations face today is **phishing**. So, what is phishing?

- Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
- Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
- Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

  
At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through **phishing simulation campaigns:**

- We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
- We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

### What can a phishing email look like?

A few months back, we detected a phishing email that was being used by an external bad actor on some of our employees.

Thankfully, it failed due to being an **obvious fake.** However, we know that phishing emails are now getting very sophisticated and a range of tactics are used.

Start the quick quiz to learn what an ‘obvious fake’ might look like.

What is the first issue you spot in this phishing email?
- The email looks legitimate
- **Suspicious looking source email address**
- The subject line says URGENT!

Correct! First of all, there is a typo in the email address. You can also see that it is coming from gmail, not a Mastercard email.

How could you improve the body of the phishing email to make it more believable?
- Write more text
- **Improve the spelling, grammar & sloppy layout**
- Suspicious or unusual attachments
- Nothing! This email is expertly put together.

That's right - in addition to this, the hyperlink could be masked in plain text.

### Your task is to create a believable phishing email

Your manager wants you to lead Mastercard’s next phishing simulation campaign. This is an awesome opportunity for you to step up and show what you can do.

The first step is to create the fake phishing email to use in the simulation.

You’ve just seen what an ‘obvious fake’ looks like, so it’s important to make yours **contextual** and **believable** to increase the likelihood of an employee clicking on the phishing link.

### Improve the phishing email

Using the text box below, you need to **recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it more believable.** Remember the end goal is to encourage the user to click on the link.

To create a ‘good’ phishing email, you should:

- Add some context at the beginning - make it relevant to a Mastercard employee
- Mask the hyperlink within text
- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Add points of legitimacy

Once you've submitted your email, we'll show you an example of a good phishing email.

Here is the obvious fake:

### Example Phishing Email

There are many ways you could have attempted this task, as phishing emails come in all shapes & sizes. Below you'll find one example of an improved phishing email - take note of some of the improvements made.

## Task 2: Interpret phishing simulation results

#### What you'll learn

- How to identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing
- How to design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack

#### What you'll do

- Create a short presentation to help teams improve security awareness

### It's time to identify and train your teams

The phishing simulation designed in the first task was run last week. So, what’s next?

We’ve used some tools to analyze the results and we can see the failure rate of each department - it is clear that some teams appear more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.

Now that we have these results, we need to:

- **identify** which areas of the business need **more awareness** about phishing, and
- **design** and **implement** the appropriate **training** for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.

### Interpret the results

First, let’s have a look at the results of the phishing campaign.

This table helps you to identify which teams appear to be **more likely** to fall for a phishing email than others.

| **Team**            | **Email open rate** | **Email click-through rate** | **Phishing success rate** |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| IT                  | 80%                 | 2%                           | 0%                        |
| HR                  | 100%                | 85%                          | 75%                       |
| Card Services       | 60%                 | 50%                          | 10%                       |
| Reception           | 40%                 | 10%                          | 0%                        |
| Engineering         | 70%                 | 4%                           | 1%                        |
| Marketing           | 65%                 | 40%                          | 38%                       |
| R&D                 | 50%                 | 5%                           | 2%                        |
| **Overall average** | **66%**             | **28%**                      | **18%**                   |

When you’re ready, start the quick quiz to see if you’ve correctly identified the most vulnerable teams. 

### Here are some resources to help you

The percentages shown are based off the total number of staff members who **received** the email. 

For example if 100 people received the email and 50 people opened it - the email open rate would be 50%.

- **Email open rate** = the percentage of people that opened it
- **Email click-through rate** = the percentage of people that clicked on the link
- **Phishing success rate** = the percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information

Which teams performed poorly in the phishing simulation?

- Marketing and Card Services teams  
- IT and Reception teams  
- **HR and Marketing teams**  
- HR and Engineering teams  
  
Correct! The HR and Marketing teams performed poorly in the simulation and should receive further training.

### Create a short presentation

Now that you've analyzed the results, it's time to create a short presentation (3-5 slides) providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.

Remember that employees at times view training as boring - so try to make the presentation clear, concise and easy to understand. Try to educate employees on what phishing is, as well as provide examples of tactics often used. Use any resources you choose, the more creative, the better!

### Example Presentation

Take a look at the example presentation, which has been prepared by a Security Awareness professional at Mastercard, to learn how they would have approached this task.

[Link to Presentation](Task 2 - Answer.pdf)

The main takeaway points from the example presentation include:

1. They use contextual & visual examples of how to spot phishing emails
2. The presentation is clear, concise & heavy on the visuals
3. They provide clear & concise action points
